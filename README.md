## Features

- üõ†Ô∏è Auto-fix unused exports ‚Äî removes the `export` keyword from the declaration or the whole declaration based on its usage
- üßπ Deletes TypeScript modules that have no referenced exports
- üïµÔ∏è `--check` mode ‚Äî reports unused exports and deletable files without writing changes

## Introduction

When TypeScript's `compilerOptions.noUnusedLocals` is enabled, it's possible to detect declarations that are not referenced in your file.

```typescript
// TypeScript will throw error: 'a' is declared but its value is never read.
const a = 'a';
```

However when this declaration is exported and is not referenced by any file in the project, it's difficult to recognize this.

```typescript
// no errors will be reported even if the declaration is not used across the entire project.
export const a = 'a';
```

This is when ts-remove-unused comes in handy. ts-remove-unused is a CLI tool built on top of TypeScript that finds unused exports and auto-fixes unused code.

Here are some examples of how ts-remove-unused auto-fixes unused code.

When `a2` is not used within the project:

```diff
--- src/a.ts
+++ src/a.ts
@@ -1,3 +1 @@
 export const a = 'a';
-
-export const a2 = 'a2';
```

When `b` is not used within the project but `f()` is used within the project:

```diff

+++ src/b.ts
@@ -1,5 +1,5 @@
-export const b = 'b';
+const b = 'b';

```

When `f()` is not used within the project and when deleting it will result in `import` being unnecessary:

```diff

-import { cwd } from "node:process";

When `f()` and `exported` are not used within the project and when deleting `f()` will result in `exported` and `local` being unnecessary:

```diff

-const local = "local";
-

```

In addition to the behavior shown in the examples above, ts-remove-unused will delete files that have no used exports.

ts-remove-unused supports various types of exports including variable declarations (`export const`, `export let`), function declarations, class declarations, interface declarations, type alias declarations, default exports and more...

Now you don't have to worry about removing unused code by yourself!

## Install

```bash
npm install @line/ts-remove-unused
```

TypeScript is a peer dependency so make sure that it's also installed.

## Usage

```
Usage:
  $ ts-remove-unused

Commands:
    There are no subcommands. Simply execute ts-remove-unused

For more info, run any command with the `--help` flag:
  $ ts-remove-unused --help

Options:
  --project <file>         Path to your tsconfig.json
  --skip <regexp_pattern>  Specify the regexp pattern to match files that should be skipped from transforming
  --include-d-ts           Include .d.ts files in target for transformation
  --check                  Check if there are any unused exports without removing them
  -h, --help               Display this message
  -v, --version            Display version number
```

ts-remove-unused's behavior heavily depends on your `tsconfig.json`. TypeScript's compiler internally holds the list of project files by parsing relevant rules such as `include` and `exclude`. ts-remove-unused scans through this list and searches for references to determine if an export/file is "unused". You may need to maintain/update your `tsconfig` (or you can create another file for `--project`) so that the set of covered files are right.

Here's an example of using the CLI. Your entry point file must be skipped or else every file will be removed.

```bash
npx @line/ts-remove-unused --skip 'src/main\.ts'
```

> [!WARNING]
> THIS COMMAND WILL DELETE CODE FROM YOUR PROJECT. Using it in a git controlled environment is highly recommended. If you're just playing around use `--check`.

### Check

Use `--check` to check for unused files and exports without making changes to project files. The command will exit with exit code 1 if there are any unused files or exports discovered.

```bash
npx @line/ts-remove-unused --skip 'src/main\.ts' --check
```

### Use the JavaScript API

Alternatively, you can use the JavaScript API to execute ts-remove-unused.

```typescript
import { remove } from '@line/ts-remove-unused';

remove({
  configPath: '/path/to/project/tsconfig.json',
  projectRoot: '/path/to/project',
  skip: [/main\.ts/],
  mode: 'write',
});
```

### Skip

When you add a comment `// ts-remove-unused-skip` to your export declaration, it will be skipped from being removed

```ts
// ts-remove-unused-skip
export const hello = 'world';
```

The `--skip` option is also available to skip files that match a given regex pattern. Note that you can pass multiple patterns.

```bash
npx @line/ts-remove-unused --skip 'src/main\.ts' --skip '/pages/'
```

By default, `.d.ts` files are skipped. If you want to include `.d.ts` files, use the `--include-d-ts` option.

## How does ts-remove-unused handle test files?

If you have a separate tsconfig for tests using [Project References](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html), that would be great! ts-remove-unused will remove exports/files that exist for the sake of testing.

If you pass a `tsconfig.json` to the CLI that includes both the implementation and the test files, ts-remove-unused will remove your test files since they are not referenced by your entry point file (which is specified in `--skip`). You can avoid tests being deleted by passing a pattern that matches your test files to `--skip` in the meantime, but the recommended way is to use project references to ensure your TypeScript config is more robust and strict (not just for using this tool).
